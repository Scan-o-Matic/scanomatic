        <p>
            We use GitHub's issue tracker to report bugs and discuss future
            extensions of the program.
            You find it <a href="https://github.com/local-minimum/scanomatic/issues" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Please first have a check if someone has already reported the same
            issue and add to that issue instead of opening a duplicate issue.
            If you are proficient in python, javascript or relevant technology
            to contribute to the solution we are of course very happy to
            include your patches.

class PhenotypeDataType(Enum):
    """The enum contains two types of phenotype classifications.

    There are three that deal with data-source/type `Scalar`, `Vector`, `Phases`.
    There are three that deal with stage `Trusted`, `UnderDevelopment`, `Other`.

    _NOTE_: A stage will always include the more trusted stages phenotypes too.
    So to see what phenotypes are actually under development one needs to do:
    ```set(PhenotypeDataType.UnderDevelopment).difference(PhenotypeDataTypes.Trusted)```

    To test if a phenotype is of a certain type you do:
     ```set(PhenotypeDataType.UnderDevelopment()).difference(PhenotypeDataType.Trusted())```.

    Attributes:
        PhenotypeDataType.Scalar: The phenotype is scalar, this is the default expectation
        PhenotypeDataType.Vector: These are the phenotype that are entire vectors:
            [`VectorPhenotypes.PhasesPhenotypes`, `VectorPhenotypes.PhasesClassification`,
             `Phenotypes.GrowthVelocityVector`]
        PhenotypeDataType.Phases: The two vector phenotypes above that clearly deals with phases.
        PhenotypeDataType.Trusted: Phenotypes that have been verified and are unlikely to change.
        PhenotypeDataType.UnderDevelopment: Phenotypes that are very likely to change and may include
            bugs and errors.
        PhenotypeDataType.Other: Typically disused or discarded phenotypes.
        PhenotypeDataType.All: All growth phenotypes.

    Methods:
        classify: List the types that a phenotype fulfills.
